### Using the Module
Its very simple to use this module. Create an object of the Class and then feed the `update()` with pygame-events.
- It will create surfaces of each line and store it in list only when any key is pressed for efficient rendering. List can be get using `get_surface()`.
- Then call the 	`render()`.
- If you don't want the text object to be updated with events.
  - Pass `False` to `update()`.
  - It will not take any input and it will not render cursor too indicating its inactive.
